This project was an experiment to test VR in Godot 3. The engine in general has come a long way so besides these additions, this project should be considered obselete. Godot 4's [V-Sekai](https://v-sekai.org/) is now my focus for Godot VR. Codebase and file structure are quite graphic so viewer's discretion is advised.
Post-mortem updates (starting 1:30):
- replaced copyrighted HDRI with AI-generated
- a perfunctory README
- VR/non-VR menu
- variable sfx volume
- double-hit/noclip fix
